// Serves the legacy CMsgClientGetUserStats (EMsg 818) achievement request on
// Linux by injecting a CMsgClientGetUserStatsResponse (819) routed to the waiting
// CAPIJobRequestUserStats. The Linux Steam client fetches achievements for many
// apps via this legacy CM message (CAPIJobRequestUserStats picks it over the
// Player.GetUserStats#1 service method when appid < a runtime threshold), so the
// achievements our store holds only reach the library UI through this path.
//
// Flow: observe the outbound 818 (its jobid + appid) -> build the 819 body from
// the store -> wrap it as a CProtoBufNetPacket with a header whose jobid_target
// is the 818's jobid -> route it via CJobMgr::BRouteMsgToJob, which resumes the
// suspended job exactly as a real server reply would.
